# Project 5: Big Data with PySpark using Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains the materials and solutions for Project 5, focusing on Big Data analysis using PySpark within an Anaconda environment and Jupyter Notebook. The project covers a range of tasks from data manipulation to complex queries involving temperature and precipitation data.

## Important Notes

- Please ensure to start working on the project well before the deadline. Late submissions will not be granted an extension.
- There has been a noted issue with accessing the weather data via the provided URL. To address this, the necessary dataset has been packaged as `data.zip` and is available in this repository for direct download and use.

## Project Structure

This project includes the following main components:

1. **Jupyter Notebook (`bigdata.ipynb`)**: Contains the PySpark code and commands used to perform the data analysis tasks outlined below.
2. **Results File (`result.txt`)**: A text file containing all the results information from the executed PySpark operations.

## Tasks Overview

The project consists of the following tasks, aimed at exploring weather data across various years:

1. **Hottest Day Analysis**: Identify the hottest day of each year, including the station code, name, and date.
2. **Coldest Day in January**: Determine the coldest day in January across all years (2010 - 2022), including station details and date.
3. **Precipitation Extremes in 2015**: Find the maximum and minimum precipitation events in 2015, with corresponding station information.
4. **Wind Gust Data Completeness for 2019**: Calculate the percentage of missing wind gust data for the year 2019.
5. **Temperature Statistics for 2020**: Analyze the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of temperatures for each month of 2020.

## Data Access

The dataset required for this project is provided in the `data.zip` file within this repository. Ensure to extract and use this data for the analysis tasks.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook installed. Download the provided `data.zip` file and extract its contents. Open the `bigdata.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to view the tasks and start coding.
